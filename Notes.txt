RabbitMQ ----> message broker that originally implements the advance Queuing Protocol (AMQP) . Producers , Broker and Consumer
Producer ---> Sends the Message
Broker ----> Holds The Message
Consumer ---> Consume the Message

Key Feature :
  Security : support authentication , authorization , LDAP and TLS via RabbitMQ Plugins

  Reliability : support two-way communication ( confirms message delivered to broker and    consumer confirms message consume by Consumer)

Interoperability : message transfer as Stream of bytes any client can operate on irrespective of any language

Producer is not tightly coupled with Queue , producer sends message to Exchange and exchange passes to Queue (Exchange and Queue are linked together using Routing Key)
